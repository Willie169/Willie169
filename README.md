Hello world! I am **Willie169**, **Willie Shen**, or **沈威宇**, a 18-year-old, 12th-grade senior high school student in Taiwan.

I am the Chef Programming Officer of [**PythonIsSlowOrg**](https://github.com/PythonIsSlowOrg), the former Assistant Professor of the Zhi-Chan School of the [**Chinese Classics Culture Education Association of Taiwan (TACLASSICS)**](https://taclassics.org.tw), and the former Chief Editor of the **CSJ Literature Group**. This is my [**Bluesky**](https://bsky.app/profile/willie169.bsky.social) account.

The languages I use most often are **Traditional Chinese** (native, main), **English** (main), **C/C++** (main), **JavaScript**, **Java**, **Python**, **Shell**, **LaTaX** (main), and **HTML**.

One of my best projects is [**Android Non Root**](https://github.com/Willie169/Android-Non-Root), which has three versions [**HTML**](https://willie169.github.io/Android-Non-Root), [**Markdown**](https://github.com/Willie169/Android-Non-Root), and [**App**](https://github.com/Willie169/Android-Non-Root-App). It is a tutorial that explores a range of powerful, open-source tools such as [Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app), [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org), [Shizuku](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku), [Tor](https://www.torproject.org), [TrackerControl](https://github.com/TrackerControl/tracker-control-android), [InviZible Pro](https://github.com/Gedsh/InviZible), [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org), [Tailscale](https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale), [OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com), and [PipePipe](https://github.com/InfinityLoop1308/PipePipe) to enhance your Android device’s functionality, security, privacy, and customization without the need for root access.

Secondly, my [**termux-sh**](https://github.com/Willie169/termux-sh) project contains Shell scripts for [Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app), a terminal emulator for Android. These scripts include setup automation, shortcuts, installations and configurations of development tools and emulation environments such as proot, proot-distro, QEMU system emulation, and box64, and more.

Thirdly, my development about LaTeX are:

* [**LaTeX-ToolKit**](https://github.com/Willie169/LaTeX-ToolKit): a comprehensive and customizable LaTeX template, LaTeX Tips, and other utilities.
* [**physics-patch**](https://github.com/Willie169/physics-patch): an improved version of the physics package covering all its commands that addresses unconventional behaviors, extends commands, and introduces additional macros.

Some of my studies are:

* [**tw-gifted-k12-notes**](https://github.com/Willie169/tw-gifted-k12-notes): notes on Taiwan's senior high school curriculum subjects and its extended fields made with LaTeX and available in PDF.
* [**tw-options-and-futures-analysis-and-rnn-pricing**](https://github.com/Willie169/tw-options-and-futures-analysis-and-rnn-pricing): a study on the deep learning pricing model of Taiwan's issue-weighted stock price index, its futures and options, and other economic and interest rate data.
* [**PID**](https://github.com/Willie169/PID) and its [site](https://Willie169.github.io/PID): an advanced PID controller designed to regulate the speed of an Arduino auto-following kart with a leader robot with a car simulation, a testing and optimizing framework, and an Arduino practice. The content of its site is outdated and stop being updated. Please refer to the PDFs in it for latest updates.

Later comes the board game **Mancala**, I've made an Android app version: [**mancala-android**](https://github.com/Willie169/mancala-android), and a CLI version: [**mancala-cli**](https://github.com/Willie169/mancala-cli).

In addition, I've made some contributions to open source projects such as [**grammars-v4**](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4), [**sshx**](https://github.com/suutaku/sshx), and [**MCP-Bridge**](https://github.com/SecretiveShell/MCP-Bridge).

Lastly, some of my other works include:

* [**MarkdownToLatexConverter**](https://github.com/Willie169/MarkdownToLatexConverter): a NPM package converting Markdown to LaTeX.
* [**github-link-converter-downloader**](https://github.com/Willie169/github-link-converter-downloader) and its [site](https://Willie169.github.io/github-link-converter-downloader): a NPM package and a site for GitHub link format converting and downloading files on GitHub.
* [**format-converter**](https://github.com/Willie169/format-converter): JavaScripts for mark-up language converting and more.
* [**ubuntu-setup-with-vnc-and-gpu**](https://github.com/Willie169/ubuntu-setup-with-vnc-and-gpu): scirpts for Ubuntu setup, including tools installation, tigervnc, virtualgl and turbovnc, nvidia, etc.
* [**termuxrunner**](https://github.com/Willie169/termuxrunner): an Android app that serves as an alternative frontend for Termux that ignores output for simplicity.

My favorite subjects are computer science, information engineering, electrical engineering, economics, finance, physics, and mathematics. 

I am interested in algorithmic investment management about stocks, futures, foreign exchange, cryptocurrency, and financial derivatives. I now mostly use recursive neural network and reinforcement learning and practice by trading simulation of items on [TWSE](https://www.twse.com.tw), [TPEx](https://www.tpex.org.tw), and [TAIFEX](https://www.taifex.com.tw).

I enjoy playing [**webDiplomacy**](https://github.com/kestasjk/webDiplomacy), Chinese chess (Xiang-qi), and chess, watching anime, reading, writing, and coding in my free time.
